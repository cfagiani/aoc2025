# Advent of Code 2025

This year's attempt at the Advent of Code puzzles (See https://adventofcode.com/2025). All the solutions in this repo
use Java 21. Each solution class (under the aoc.solutions package) has its own main method. Most solutions require
input files. The path to the input directory is taken as the sole command line argument to each solution program. Since
data files are different for different users, they are not committed to this repo.

NOTE: Solutions to these puzzles are quick and dirty rather than polished. They lack any sort of boundary checking on
inputs nor are there unit tests or other things one would normally include in a *real* project. Similarly, since the
second half of the problem isn't revealed until the first half is solved, some of the design choices are based on
speculation as to the nature of the problem.
